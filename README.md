- 👋 Hi, I’m @pareenakaur, SG undergrad comp sci student currently studying at Nanyang Technological University.
- 👀 I’m interested in full-stack development, data science and AI. 
- 🌱 I’m proficient in programming langs like Python and Java. I am learning to apply my programming skills to develop applications! For that, I am learning front-end using React and Angular. I am also learning pytorch for computer vision and tensorflow to build neural networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building apps, webpages, and more! Love to explore anything and everything.
- 📫 You can reach me on telegram: @gubble_bum
